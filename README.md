# Data preparation for UCI HAR activity recognition

This repository contains

- README: summary of dataset supplied and process to follow
- codebook: description of the data used, outputs and process to follow
- r_analysis script: r script to download and transform the dataset for use
- tidy dataset: final cleaned dataset for further use

Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

This data has been captured and made available for public download. The files in this repository apply a level of cleaning and transformation so that this data is easier to use than it was when initially supplied.
